title: Student Projects
---

I am interested in supervising student projects that explore the correctness of **concurrent and distributed systems**, often through the development of tools for **visualisation tools**, **simulation** and other **applications**. Projects can range from practical implementations (such as building safe communication apps or simulators) to exploratory tools that illustrate core ideas in system reliability and protocol design. I believe students benefit most from working in **groups of two or three**, where they can collaborate and share expertise. I am happy to supervise projects from all study programmes, both at the BSc and MSc level, including MSc theses.



**Projects:**

- **Distributed Protocol Visualisation**
  + Develop a tool that reads a specification of a communication protocol (in a choreographic language or some other simple DSL) and produces an interactive visualisation that represents the protocol. By interacting with it, one can explore the different possible runs of the protocol, including branching choices, concurrent steps, and parallel interactions. The project will require designing a small protocol language or format, implementing the visualisation tool, and exploring case studies. The project deliverables include a working prototype with at least two protocols fully represented and a report on how concurrency and protocol correctness are modelled. As an optional extension, the tool may simulate probabilistic message delivery.
  + **Keywords:** visualisation, distributed protocols, concurrency, tooling
  + **Level:** BSc/MSc

- **Analysing Message Exchange Implementation**
  + Find an implementation of a message exchange system, e.g., a chat-style message exchange, and model it using a protocol language, e.g., a choreographic language. Verify that the implementation adheres to the protocol specification. Extra mile: consider handling dropped/out-of-order messages.
  + **Keywords:** messaging, protocols, distributed systems
  + **Level:** BSc/MSc
