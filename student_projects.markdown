title: Student Projects
---

I am interested in supervising student projects that explore the correctness of **concurrent and distributed systems**, often through the development of tools for **visualisation tools**, **simulation** and other **applications**. Projects can range from practical implementations (such as building safe communication apps or simulators) to exploratory tools that illustrate core ideas in system reliability and protocol design. I believe students benefit most from working in **groups of two or three**, where they can collaborate and share expertise. I am happy to supervise projects from all study programmes, both at the BSc and MSc level, including MSc theses.
