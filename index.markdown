## Short Bio

* I'm an Associate Professor at the [Computer Science
Department](https://wiki.itu.dk/computerscience/index.php/Main_Page),
[IT University of Copenhagen](https://www.itu.dk).  Since 2018, I am
also head (linjeleder) of the [MSc. in Computer
Science](https://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Computer-Science)
study programme. Formerly, 2014-18, I was heading the MSc. in Software
Development.

* I'm a member of the [Programming, Logics and
  Semantics](https://pls.itu.dk) research group and the [Center of
  Information Security and Trusts](https://cisat.dk).

* Before joining ITU, I was a post-doc at [Imperial College
  London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/) and
  [QMUL](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk) (with Honda and
  [Yoshida](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nobuko.yoshida/)). In 2005,
  I received my PhD in Computer Science (“Trust and Mobility”) from
  [BRICS](https://brics.dk), Aarhus University supervised by
  Prof. M. Nielsen.

## Research Interests

My core research interests are within applications of semantics, type
theory, and linear logic to concurrency. In particular, I'm an expert
in the pi-calculus concurrency model, session types (I'm one of the
authors of multiparty session types), and choreography models.

I am also interested in applications of my theoretical work. In
particular, I'm interested in the design and usage of (extensions of)
programming languages that make strong use of session types and
choreographic specifications for safety of critical systems.

## Publications

The most (and very) up-to-date page is my
[DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/41/1366.html) entry. My ITU [publication
page](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/marco-carbone) is updated once a
year. For old stuff, look
